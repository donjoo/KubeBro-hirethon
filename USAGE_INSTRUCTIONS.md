### 5. Troubleshooting

#### If you see "Error loading tickets":
1. **Make sure you're logged in** - You need to be authenticated to access tickets
2. **Check your internet connection** - The frontend needs to communicate with the backend
3. **Try refreshing the page** - Sometimes the authentication state needs to be refreshed

#### If you can't see the "Create Ticket" button:
1. **Ensure you're logged in** - The button only appears for authenticated users
2. **Check the navigation** - Make sure you're on the "Support Tickets" page
3. **Verify permissions** - Regular users should see the create button

#### If you get 403 Forbidden errors:
1. **Login again** - Your session might have expired
2. **Check your credentials** - Make sure you're using the correct email/password
3. **Clear browser cache** - Sometimes cached data can cause issues

### 6. API Testing

You can also test the system directly via API:

#### Login:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "testpass123"}'
```

#### Create Ticket:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tickets/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Test Ticket", "description": "Test description", "category": "support", "priority": "medium"}'
```
